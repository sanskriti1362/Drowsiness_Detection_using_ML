# Drowsiness_Detection_using_ML

This is a driver-drowsiness detection system that basically helps the driver to stay alert when feeling drowsy. For this project, I have used MRL Dataset that has 84,898 images
of 37 different persons (33 men and 4 women) in differnt light condtions and other various parameters. The system produces an alarm when it finds that the driver's eyes are closed for more than 10 seconds.
